How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff -u shows the exact places where the changes were introduced and which lines were removed with the help of ++ and -- signs .

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    git log provides history of commits made along with their commit ids and github allows to keep the entire history which is very very helpful in cases when the bug got introduced and to keep the master branch and other branches separate.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros
    user has choice
    no need to auto save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
